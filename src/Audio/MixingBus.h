    /** NOTES FROM JUCE FORUM ON MIXING Audio Sources:
    You can connect your AudioTransportSources to a MixerAudioSource 10, and call
    the mixersâ€™s getNextAudioBlock() instead (which will then call the individual
    ones of the transportSources and mix the signal automatically).

    Please note, if you are planning to write an audio engine like that, you
    should use a different approach, because the timing of play/stop events on
    AudioTransportSources is very coarse, and musically not usable, because:

    - start/stop happens on the message thread. There can be any kind of delay,
    when your GUI is busy with other things
    - start/stop can only happen at full buffers,
    so you get discrete events with a deviation of up to 20ms (with typical 512
    samples @ 48kHz) from the actual trigger

    Usually you write an audio mixer yourself, that can take any sample position
    into account inside individual buffers, and that can update the play/stop and
    position parameters in the audio thread, to stay synchronised with the rest of
    the audio.
